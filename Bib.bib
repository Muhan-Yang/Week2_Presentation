  title    = {Geospatial Analysis with Landsat Series and Sentinel-3B OLCI Satellites to Assess Changes in Land Use and Water Quality over Time in Brazil},
  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {Geospatial analyses have gained fundamental importance on a global scale following emphasis on sustainability. Here we geospatially analyze images from Landsat 2/5/7/8 satellites captured during 1975 to 2020 in order to determine changes in land use. Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) images obtained in 2019 and 2021 were utilized to assess water resources, based on water turbidity levels (TSM_NN), suspended pollution potential (ADG_443_NN) and the presence of chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN) in order to temporally monitor the effectiveness of Brazilian legislation currently in force. This work on sustainability standards was applied to a hydrographic basin dedicated to agricultural production located in southern Brazil. Satellite images from Landsat 2/5/7/8 (1975 to 2020) and Sentinel-3B OLCI (2019 and 2021) revealed that changes in land use, vegetation cover and water in the Capinguí Dam reservoir detected high concentrations of ADG_443_NN (3830 m-1), CHL_NN (20,290 mg m-3) and TSM_NN (100 gm-3). These results can alert the population to the risks to public health and harm to hydrographic preservation, capable of covering large regions.},

  title    = {The Use of Sentinel-3 Altimetry Data to Assess Wind Speed from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model: Application over the Gulf of Cadiz},
  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {This work presents the quality performance and the capabilities of altimetry derived wind speed (WS) retrievals from the altimeters on-board Copernicus satellites Sentinel-3A/B (S3A/B) for the spatial assessment of WS outputs from the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model over the complex area of the Gulf of Cádiz (GoC), Spain. In order to assess the applicability of the altimetry data for this purpose, comparisons between three different WS data sources over the area were evaluated: in situ measurements, S3A/B 20 Hz altimetry data, and WRF model outputs. Sentinel-3A/B WS data were compared against two different moored buoys to guarantee the quality of the data over the GoC, resulting in satisfying scores (average results: RMSE = 1.21 m/s, r = 0.93 for S3A and RMSE = 1.36 m/s, r = 0.89 for S3B). Second, the WRF model was validated with in situ data from four different stations to ensure the correct performance over the area. Finally, the spatial variability of the WS derived from the WRF model was compared with the along-track altimetry-derived WS. The analysis was carried out under different wind synoptic conditions. Qualitative and quantitative results (average RMSE < 1.0 m/s) show agreement between both data sets under low/high wind regimes, proving that the spatial coverage of satellite altimetry enables the spatial assessment of high-resolution numerical weather prediction models in complex water-covered zones.},

  abstract  = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) have been a concern for aquatic systems, especially those used for water supply and recreation. Thus, the monitoring of CHABs is essential for the establishment of water governance policies. Recently, remote sensing has been used as a tool to monitor CHABs worldwide. Remote monitoring of CHABs relies on the optical properties of pigments, especially the phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a). The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of recent launch the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify PC and chl-a. To do this, OLCI images were collected over the Western part of Lake Erie (U.S.A.) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. When comparing the use of traditional remote sensing algorithms to estimate PC and chl-a, none was able to accurately estimate both pigments. However, when single and band ratios were used to estimate these pigments, stronger correlations were found. These results indicate that spectral band selection should be re-evaluated for the development of new algorithms for OLCI images. Overall, Sentinel 3/OLCI has the potential to be used to identify PC and chl-a. However, algorithm development is needed.},
